Asymptotic Analysis is the big idea that handles the above issues in analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis, we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don’t measure the actual running time). We calculate, order of growth of time taken (or space) by an algorithm in terms of input size. For example linear search grows linearly and Binary Search grows logarithmically in terms of input size.

**Asymptotic Notations:**
- Big-O Notation (O-notation)
- Omega Notation (Ω-notation)
- Theta Notation (Θ-notation)
