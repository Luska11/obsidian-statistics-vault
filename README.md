## Intro

ðŸ“Š This Obsidian vault stores statistics studies. It includes key concepts, formulas, practical examples, and insights. The notes are structured and interconnected to make learning and review easier.

## Utils

To input mathematical expressions in Obsidian, you can use LaTeX notation enclosed in `$$`. For instance:

- To write a simple equation like $E = mc^2$, type: `$E = mc^2$`.
- For more complex equations such as the SchrÃ¶dinger equation:
	$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)=-\frac{\hbar}{2m}\nabla^{2}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)+V(\mathbf{r},t)\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$, type: 
	```
	$$
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)=-\frac{\hbar}{2m}\nabla^{2}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)+V(\mathbf{r},t)\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
	$$
	```
